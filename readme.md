## Features ✨

- **Address-Based Location Selection**: Input an address, and the app automatically fetches the corresponding latitude and longitude.
- **Wind Data Retrieval**: Retrieves historical daily wind speed and gust data from the Open-Meteo API.
- **Wind Turbine Energy Calculation**: Estimates the total energy generation of a wind turbine based on the wind data and turbine specifications.
- **Interactive Graphs**: Visualize daily wind speed and gust data with Plotly, including indicators for exceeding the turbine's maximum wind speed.
- **Performance Metrics**: Compare the wind data to average values and assess the turbine's performance.

## Installation 🛠️

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/wind-turbine-analysis.git
    cd wind-turbine-analysis
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run main.py
    ```

## Usage 🚀

1. **Set Wind Turbine Parameters**:
    - Adjust the start wind speed, max wind speed, rated wind speed, and rated power from the sidebar.

2. **Enter Location and Date Range**:
    - Input the address (e.g., "Warszawa, Aleje Jerozolimskie") and select the start and end dates for your analysis.

3. **Fetch Data**:
    - Click "Fetch Data" to retrieve the wind data and automatically calculate the energy generated by the wind turbine.

4. **View Results**:
    - The daily wind data is visualized on an interactive graph.
    - Performance metrics such as total energy generated, max wind speed, average wind speed, and minimum speed are displayed in the analysis section.

## Dependencies 🧰

- `streamlit`: Web app framework for data science.
- `pandas`: Data analysis and manipulation tool.
- `numpy`: Numerical computing package.
- `requests`: HTTP library for Python.
- `geopy`: Geocoding library to convert addresses into latitude and longitude.
